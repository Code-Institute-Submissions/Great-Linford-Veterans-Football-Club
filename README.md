Management consists of the following members; club secretary, treasurer, managers, social team. They will be using the site to help communicate with players, other management staff, opponents and fans.

Management will also use the player stats in the team page to help motivate players and will use the information at the end of the season at their awards ceremony.

The management team has set up a competition to find the best match report to be hosted on the website, each player has to write a report before the end of the season and the winner will receive a prize at the end of the season. This will also provide great team moral.

Each week Managers/Secretary are contacted by opponents to confirm fixtures and instructions on how to find the ground, the website will be used and shared to help opponents contact and find the club. 

The social club will be using the site to host images from social activities along with match day images. They can also share next events on the scroller.

## Features

Every page has the navigation bar with the club crest on the left hand side and an H2 heading with the words "Great Linford Veterans Football Club" central under the Navbar. The nabar also features a hamburger icon when viewed on mobile devices. Every page also has the same footer, this consists of social media links, copyright information and the team sponsor, when clicking on the sponsor you are taken to the sponsor's website in a new page. 

### Marquee scroll bar
All pages have the Marquee scroller. This was the main ask of the club, to show the clubs next fixtures and any updates that happen. This feature is meant to be the first thing users see when accessing the website. The scroll bar is at the top of the body on every page.

### Home page
There is a fixed image of a football on the homepage, this is a design decision due to the lack content on the first page. Below the image, you will see the history of the club and a team photo (note - this is a placeholder image until the team submit their own), this is a traditional feature of football clubs websites, when viewing this page on mobile the image moves below the history information. Another need for the club is to show opponents how to get to the ground,as it is not easy to find. To solve this problem you will see a how to find us section using Google Map in a frame and once clicked, users will be able to get directions from google maps.


### Team page
This will be the most used page at the club. First, you have two columns. Both link out to the official FA full-time websites where all fixtures, results and league tables are updated. The first column links directly to Great Linfords league table, the second, links directly to Great Linfords fixtures. The purpose of this link is for players and management to have a quick easy access to the league table and fixtures. On large screens the columns show as two, reducing to one on mobile devices.

Next is the main feature of the website, the player stats. All player stats from each and every game will be hosted here using bootstrap progress bar. This will keep team moral up and creates a welcomed competitive environment. The stats will be used at the end of the season to help choose individual performance awards. On large screens you will see two players per row, this reduces to one on mobile devices.


### Match Report
There is a fixed image on this page with the words Match report,the page will host all match reports for the season, the club nominates a player to write a match report and they have a competition for the best report of the season. There will be a match report submitted after every game.

### Social

The first section on this page is to support the clubs luck 7's predictor game. The club selects 7 teams each week from the FA fixture list and challenges users to predict the winner of the fixtures, using the letters H (home), A (away) or D (draw). The site will show these fixtures each week for users to predict, charging them a pound for each prediction. The winner/s share the pot with the club, this game raises 60% of the club's income each year. There is also a form where users can predict and submit, The form is not yet complete as I need to learn how to push data to email addresses, this will be added to the features left to implement.


### Contact

On this page you have a section on the club committee member, giving users information on who is who at the club. Each member is situated in a column and these columns reduce to one per row on mobile devices. The page hosts a contact us form, the form has placeholder tags to guide the user on what information is needed. The form is not yet complete as I need to learn how to push data to email addresses, this will be added to the features left to implement.


### Features Left to Implement

* Team picture will replace the placeholder image on the home page.

* On the team page, all players will have a summary profile, the team are writing their own, once they are complete, they will be added.

* Player pictures will also be updated with kit and player images.

* Social page - The form on this page only directs to the codeinstitute; once I learn how, it will be a fully functional form, sending predictions to the organisers webpage. 

* Social page - Palpal payment will also be included on the form for the lucky 7's game for easy payment.

* Gallery on the social page - I will replace placeholder images once the team sends new ones in.

* Contact page - The form on this page only directs to the codeinstitute; once i learn how, it will be a fully functional form for anyone wishing to contact the committee members.

* A form for management to be self sufficient, updating player stats, match report and the lucky 7's game.

## Technologies Used

I also used Bootstrap's core CSS for most of the styling and layout, buttons and forms; its core JavaScript for the gallery and the hamburger button. This would not have been done without the hep of [Ashley White](http://ashleydw.github.io/lightbox/) who shares his lightbox code for others to use.

### NOTE - During this project I had to work from the hospital (first baby arrival) for the first three days, I created the header/footer/index.html and team.html pages. I was adding and committing every change while creating these pages. Once I got home, it looked like the commits did not save, in fact most the work did not. This left me stressed and worried. I created the pages from scratch again, but did not commit as much as I first did.
