### Management
Management consists of the following members; club secretary, treasurer, managers, social team. They will be using the site to help communicate with players, other management staff, opponents and fans. It will also help them promote the lucky 7's game, this is responsible for 60% of the club's income. Management will also use the player stats in the team page to help motivate players and will use the information at the end of the season at their awards ceremony.

The management team has set up a competition to find the best match report to be hosted on the website, each player has to write a report before the end of the season and the winner will receive a prize at the end of the season. This will also provide great team moral.

Each week Managers/Secretary are contacted by opponents to confirm fixtures and instructions on how to find the ground, the website will be used and shared to help opponents contact and find the club. 

The social club will be using the site to host images from social activities along with match day images. They can also share next events on the scroller.

## Technologies Used

This project uses HTML and CSS languages.<br>

Bootstrap

Google Fonts

Github/Gitpod

Balsamiq 

Font Awsome


In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.



Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: *Make Public*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the backend lessons.

## Updates Since The Instructional Video

We continually tweak and adjust this template to help give you the best experience. Here are the updates since the original video was made:

**April 16 2020:** The template now automatically installs MySQL instead of relying on the Gitpod MySQL image. The message about a Python linter not being installed has been dealt with, and the set-up files are now hidden in the Gitpod file explorer.

**April 13 2020:** Added the _Prettier_ code beautifier extension instead of the code formatter built-in to Gitpod.

**February 2020:** The initialisation files now _do not_ auto-delete. They will remain in your project. You can safely ignore them. They just make sure that your workspace is configured correctly each time you open it. It will also prevent the Gitpod configuration popup from appearing.

**December 2019:** Added Eventyret's Bootstrap 4 extension. Type `!bscdn` in a HTML file to add the Bootstrap boilerplate. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/Eventyret/vscode-bcdn" target="_blank">README.md file at the official repo</a> for more options.

Happy coding!
