## Features

Every page has the navigation bar with the club crest on the left hand side and an H2 heading with the words "Great Linford Veterans Football Club" central under the Navbar. the nabar also fetures a hamburger icon when viewed on mobile devices. Every page also has the same footer, this consists of social media links, copyright information and the team sponsor, when clicking on the sponsor you are taken to the sponsor's website in a new page. 

### Marquee scroll bar
All pages have the Marquee scroller. This was the main ask of the club, to show the clubs next fixtures and any updates that happen. This feature is meant to be the first thing users see when accessing the website. The scroll bar is at the top of the body on every page.

### Home page
There is a fixed image of a football on the homepage, this is a design decision due to the lack content on the first page. Under the image, you will see the history of the club and a team photo (note - this is a placeholder image until the team submit their own), this is a traditional feature of football clubs websites, when viewing this page ona mobile the image moves below the history information. Another need for the club is to show opponents how to get to the ground,as it is not easy to find. To solve this problem you will see a how to find us section using Google Map in a frame and once clicked, users will be able to get directions from google maps.


### Team page
This will be the most used page at the club. First, you have two columns. Both link out to the official FA full-time websites where all fixtures, results and league tables are updated. The first column links directly to Great Linfords league table, the second, links directly to Great Linfords fixtures. The purpose of this link is for players and management to have a quick easy access to the league table and fixtures. On large screens the columns show as two, reducing to one on mobile devices.

Next is the main feature of the website, the player stats. All player stats from each and every game will be hosted here using botstraps progress bar. This will keep team moral up and creates a welcomed competitive environment. The stats will be used at the end of the season to help choose individual performance awards. on large screens you will see two players per row, this reduces to one on moble devices.


### Match Report
There is a fixed image on this page with the words Match report,the page will host all match reports for the season, the club nominates a player to write a match report and they have a competition for the best report of the season. Thre will be a match report submitted after every game.

### Social

The first section on this page is to support the clubs luck 7's predictor game. The club selects 7 teams each week from the FA fixture list and challenges users to predict the winner of the fixtures, using the letters H (home), A (away) or D (draw). The site will show these fixtures each week for users to predict, charging them a pound for each prediction. The winner/s share the pot with the club, this game raises 60% of the clubs income each year. There is also a form where users can predict and submit, The form is not yet complete as i need to learn how to push data to email addresses, this will added to the features left to implement.


### Contact

On this page you have a section on the club committee member, giving users information on who is who at the club. Each member is situated in a column and these columns reduce to one per row on mobile devices. The page hosts a contact us form, the form has placeholder tags to guid the user on what information is needed. The form is not yet complete as i need to learn how to push data to email addresses, this will added to the features left to implement.


### Features Left to Implement

* Team picture will replace the placeholder image on the home page.

* On the team page, all players will have a summary profile, the team are writing their own, once they are complete, they will be added.

* Player pictures will aslo be updated with kit and player.

* Social page - The form on this page only directs to the codeinstitute; once i learn how, it will be a fully functional form, sending predictions to the organisers webpage. 

* Social page - Palpal payment will also be included on the form for the lucky 7's game for easy payment.

* Gallery on the social page - will replace placeholder images once the team send new ones in.

* Contact page - The form on this page only directs to the codeinstitute; once i learn how, it will be a fully functional form for anyone wishing to contact the committee members.

* a form for management to be self sufficient, updating player stats, match report and the lucky 7's game.

## Technologies Used

* HTML5 is the markup language used for rendering the website.
[HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5)

* CSS3 is the style sheet language used to style the HTML website.
[CSS3](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS3)

* Bootstrap 4 Framework for the mobile responsiveness and grid layout of the website. 
I also used Bootstrap's core CSS for most of the styling and layout, buttons and forms; its core JavaScript for the gallery and the hamburger button. this would not have been done without the hep of [Ashley White](http://ashleydw.github.io/lightbox/) who shares his lightbox code for others to use.

# Testing

Used [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to check the markup on each page. I had one **warning** for the fixed image on the indext.html, contact.html, report.html page : **Warning: Section lacks heading. Consider using h2-h6 elements to add identifying headings to all sections**. as this is a fixed image, I won't be giving it a heading. I also had the same **warning** on the team.html page for the images in the league and fixture section, these also will not have headings.


Used [CSS3 Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to check CSS3 for any errors. "Congratulations! No Error Found. This document validates as CSS level 3 + SVG !"




4. Contact form works as intended. 
   1. Go to 'Contact Us' page.
   2. If user does not type a name, user will get a reminder, "Please fill out this field".
   3. Email needs to include @ sign and a domain. If user clicks submit without an @ sign, user will get a message, "Please include an '@' in the email address. 'user's input' is missing an '@'.
   4. User also needs to enter a domain name for email address. If user forgets to type domain name after '@' sign, there will be a reminder saying, "Please enter a part following '@'. 'userinput@ is incomplete"
   5. If user does not type anything at the text area field, user will also be prompted to type something. User will get a reminder, "Please fill out this field".
   6. Once message is sent, there will be confirmation that message was sent. "Thank you for your message!"

5. The website is responsive on majority of mobile devices. 

6. There is a parallax effect on desktop that is disabled for mobile devices but the problem now is there appears to be two background images overlapping when you scroll up the page. I still haven't figured out how to fix it.
   According to [this w3s article](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_parallax.asp) the media query should disable the effect but the issue still persist.





In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
