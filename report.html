         <div class="container-fluid">
            <h5>Great Linford having had a good preseason with 4 wins out of 5 games travelled to Cranfield for the first game of the season with a depleted squad missing Smithy, Giggsy, Olive, Liam, Eamonn, and Garrard.<br><br>
               The MK vets league version of the Cowley brothers Luke and Thommo decide to go with a 3-5-2 formation with stand in keeper Neal in goal, Culley, Wells, and Dickinson at the back. Charlie and Del at wing backs, Scotty holding midfield with Dom and Sico in the centre. Thommo and Farmer lead the line up top. Krater, Baron and Tracey were on the bench.<br><br>
               Cranfield were the only team to take points off of Linford last season in a 2-2 draw so a tough game was expected, and it was Cranfield who had the games first chance in the opening minutes. Soon after though Linford started to get a grip on the game moving the ball through the thirds. Linford took the lead after 15 minutes Del bursting down the left got passed the full back and to the by line and fizzed a low cross into the 6 yard box where a Cranfield defender could only turn it into his own net. Cranfield were almost on level terms after they applied pressure and a shot from the outside of the box hit Dickinson and wrong footing Neal in goal. It looked nailed on to go in but somehow Neal got back to make an excellent save.<br><br>
               Linford went on to take control of the game from then on with two more goals before half time. The first of which was a well struck low free kick by Culley into the bottom left corner of the goal after Thommo had been fouled at the edge of the box. Dom then made it 3-0 after more good work by Thommo let him with all the time in the world to put the ball past the keeper.<br><br>
               In the second half it didn't take Linford long to go further ahead and it was that man Culley again who won a tackle inside his own half, released the ball down the left before continuing his run up the pitch. The ball eventually getting to Dom inside the box and he very unselfishly squared it to the unmarked Culley to score. Cranfield always had a threat going forward with the no 7 proving a handful with the Linford defence often being penalised for fouls upon him. It was from one of those free kicks that Cranfield thought they had pulled a goal back when the centre back turned in a great cross past Neal but he was ruled offside.<br><br>
               As the game drew to a close tempers began to flare as a series of fouls resulted in a handbag moment when Sico somehow getting a foul awarded his way when the whole ground thought it should have gone the other way. Dom goaded by the Cranfield keeper to shoot from over 30 yards from that free kick was the comedy moment of the game. Dom didn't disappoint blazing the ball well over the bar.<br><br>
               Final result 4-0 game won in the first half. Management will be pleased with the performance and the communication in that half in particular.<br>
